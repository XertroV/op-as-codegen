# Openplanet AngelScript Code Generator

This is a code generator for Openplanet's flavor of AngelScript.

## free writing about goals / structure

What I want is a way to create certain things.
Like take a JSON spec and make a Dict/DB class that has getters/setters for the right stuff automatically and does recursive stuff.

so the input is just the json spec, right?
or a spec like that.
